## Adding elements to the Website

### Committee members

Team members are listed in [content/authors/](content/authors/). Each team member has its own subdirectory, corresponding to their **firstname-lastname**. *Please use this identifier of the members of the team (i.e., firstname-lastname) instead of their full name when encoding authors for publications, projects, and news to ensure proper linking on the website.*

Each user must be part of one of the following user groups (`user_groups:` in the `_index.md` of the user):
- Pr√©sidence
- Membres
- 'Ancien membres'

More groups can be added in the [content/people/people.md](content/people/people.md) file.
